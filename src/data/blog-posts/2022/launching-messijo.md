Messijo started from a very simple idea to monitor mentions and keywords being used on Bluesky. The goal was to build out something small in scope that helps us dogfood Waltr, another project we are working on and probably going to rebrand at some point. Messijo has grown into more than just a proof of concept and is something that we think brands across the world will find value in.

## The Current State

The MVP is available today and focuses on Bluesky for the moment. By listening to the Bluesky firehose, we are able to monitor the keywords and mentions being used on the entire platform. When someone uses a keyword you care about, you will receive a notification and those notifications include e-mail and Slack for the moment.

## Plans for the Future

Eventually, we want to add more platforms to the mix. We are currently planning to add Lobste.rs, Hacker News, and Reddit. These platforms are all great places to meet your customers and engage them where they are.

Beyond more social platforms, we are also planning to expand the ways you can be notified. Currently, Discord and Microsoft Teams are next in line, but we are open to supporting whatever our customers would prefer.
